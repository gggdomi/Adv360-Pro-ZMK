# What do I want to do with the keyboard ?

## Write words

## Write numbers

## Coding

### Special chars

### Top / Bottom panels

### Other navigation

- go to last used tab
- go to previous (bar order) tab
- go to nth tab
- jump to reference
- jump to usages


### Split window ("editor group")

- focus left/right editor group
- move current file to left/right editor group
- close all in left/right editor group
- +/- size of current editor group

### Snippets

## Navigation

### Between apps

### Between windows

### Between screens

## Chrome

- Vimium-C
  - no modifier -> all shortcuts won't be available out of Chrome (should we add a modifier for muscle memory ?)
    - otoh we can add "nav layer" and remap stuff like "ctrl+tab" to "J" for other apps

### Mouse

- warpd actually not needed if vimium? (i mostly live in VSCode + Chrome)

# How to do that

## Layers

## Combos

## Hold-tap

## Tap dance

# Random

- very customized -> it won't spread by giving tips (ie. can't say "do f12"). So personal gain but team loss?
  - otoh it'll avoid unsollicited advices and if it's really more performat, better chance to lead people to do their own setup?
